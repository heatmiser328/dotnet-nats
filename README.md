# dotnet-nats
NATS client for .NET

Lots to do...
x Connect
x Reconnect
x Disconnect
o Publish
o Subscribe
o Resubscribe after reconnect
o Clustered servers
o Anything else I can't remember right now...


### Developing

1. Fork the repo
2. Fork dotnet-sockets to a sibling folder

(tried dotnet-sockets as a submodule, but that proved too bothersome)
